# FinalDAT405

The final project I created was purely out of humour. 
My initial idea was to create an animated opossum which gradually moved its head the closer your cursor got to its body.
However this proved to be incredibly difficult as I couldn't load any gifs into the canvas, and I would have had to create too many illustrated frames to provide the effect I wanted.
Instead, I stayed with the opossum idea and made it so that 4 heads would vibrate on the canvas rapidly, and change if you clicked on them.
